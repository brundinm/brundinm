I am the Digital Services and Systems Librarian at MacEwan University Library
at MacEwan University, which is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=53.547326&mlon=-113.505018#map=15/53.547326/-113.505018" rel="nofollow">located</a>
in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  In my career (1997&ndash;present), I have worked
at The Alberta Library, Edmonton Public Library, MacEwan University (John L.
Haar Library, or MacEwan University Library), Northern Alberta Institute of
Technology (McNally Library, or NAIT Library), University of Alberta
(Department of English and Film Studies, School of Library and Information
Studies, and University of Alberta Libraries \[Cameron Library, Rutherford
North Library, and Rutherford South Library\]), University of Calgary
(Department of Community Health Sciences), and University of Western Ontario
(Faculty of Information and Media Studies).

Some of the software applications that I have developed or contributed to in my
career include the following:

- Developed scripts, wrote documentation, and generated reports for MacEwan
  University Library's MARC records editing operations that were performed when
  the Library migrated to a new library services platform.  The programming
  languages used were AWK, Bash (shell), Perl, Python, sed, and XSLT, and the
  MARC formats the scripts operated on were MARC 21 binary records, MARCXML
  and TurboMARC XML records, and MARC mnemonic text records. (2024)
- Developed numerous scripts to facilitate data processing and data
  transformation operations on data exported from, and imported to, various
  MacEwan University Library information systems. (2016&ndash;present)
- Developed the CWRC (Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory)&ndash;hosted
  Royal Society of Canada (RSC) Expert Panel on The Status and Future of
  Canada's Libraries and Archives mapping and timeline application, which used
  the SIMILE Exhibit data publishing framework to display the location of, and
  the year of establishment for, many of the libraries and archives of Canada.
  (2014)
- Contributed to various systems and software tools in the CWRC infrastructure
  platform at the University of Alberta, including data modeling, data
  transformation, and systems and tools collaborative development work with
  various software application developers. (2013&ndash;2016)
- Designed and developed a GIS (geographic information system) application for
  the Edmonton Public Library to serve as the repository for community
  profiles, and to facilitate the identification of branch library resource,
  program, and service needs. (2011)
- Developed a Microsoft Excel and VBA spreadsheet application model that
  calculated Edmonton Public Library branch library productivity (units of
  activity per hour per FTE) using a weighted formula incorporating various
  library input measures (investments and resources) and output measures
  (activity and use) to aid in branch library resource allocation decisions.
  (2010)
- Designed and created an RDF/XML metadata web application featuring web
  resources related to Alzheimer’s disease that was an experimental online
  version of the traditional library vertical file, part of a larger research
  project at the University of Western Ontario comparing traditional library
  information systems with the emerging standards and protocols of the Semantic
  Web. (2007)
- Developed a web-based survey using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP)
  stack to provide the data collection instrument for a SSHRC-funded grant to
  investigate university students’ use of instant messaging on the University
  of Western Ontario campus. (2005&ndash;2006)
- Designed and developed a digital resource repository application using a LAMP
  stack for the Canada-wide CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) in UME
  (Undergraduate Medical Education) Project out of the University of Calgary.
  Repository features included searching via Boolean operators, field
  qualification, field limits, wildcard operators, and nested searching;
  browsing via hypertext linked peer-reviewed summaries on CAM topics; browsing
  via hypertext linked controlled subject terms (descriptors) applied to
  describe the content of each resource; and a submission process so users
  could submit CAM-related resources for inclusion into the repository.
  (2005&ndash;2010)
- Developed extended services for, and resources integration within, the
  Java-based bibliographic search tool TAL Online (using OCLC’s SiteSearch set
  of tools), a virtual union catalog maintained by The Alberta Library (a
  province-wide library consortium) providing unified access to the catalogs of
  hundreds of libraries across Alberta (academic, public, and special
  libraries).  In 2002, the TAL Online team was awarded the LibraryNet Best
  Practices Award by Industry Canada and LibraryNet for innovation in a library
  communication and technology project&mdash;features that I had developed in
  TAL Online were mentioned in the announcement of the award. (2000&ndash;2002)
- Designed and created a Microsoft Access and VBA bindery database application
  to automate the bindery process at the University of Alberta Libraries.  The
  University of Alberta Libraries Bindery Database was implemented in December
  1997, and it is still in production 27 years later! (1997&ndash;2004)
- Developed an experimental web-based library catalog for a reference book
  collection using Perl CGI scripts and SSI directives at the School of Library
  and Information Studies, University of Alberta.  Reference collection catalog
  features included field-specific searching (title, author, subject), Boolean
  operator applied searching (AND, OR), and string phrase searching (exact
  query phrase); an experimental search interface to facilitate subject
  searching of the catalog by using a thesaurus of hyperlinked subject terms;
  and logging of both catalog web page visits as well as catalog search
  queries, thus making possible user activity analyses and transaction log
  analyses. (1997&ndash;1998)
