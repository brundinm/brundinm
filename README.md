I am the Digital Services and Systems Librarian at MacEwan University Library
at MacEwan University, which is located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  In my
career I have worked at The Alberta Library, Edmonton Public Library, MacEwan
University (MacEwan University Library), Northern Alberta Institute of
Technology (McNally Library), University of Alberta (Department of English and
Film Studies, School of Library and Information Studies, and University of
Alberta Libraries \[Cameron Library, Rutherford North Library, and Rutherford
South Library\]), University of Calgary (Department of Community Health
Sciences), and University of Western Ontario (Faculty of Information and Media

Some of the software applications that I have developed or contributed to in my
career include the following:

  transformation operations on data exported from, and imported to, various
  MacEwan University Library information systems.
- Developed and enhanced various systems and software applications in the CWRC
  (Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory) Islandora repository at the
  University of Alberta, including developing the CWRC-hosted Royal Society of
  Canada’s (RSC) Expert Panel on The Status and Future of Canada’s Libraries
  and Archives mapping and timeline application.
- Designed and developed a GIS application for the Edmonton Public Library to
  serve as the repository for community profiles, and to facilitate the
  identification of branch library resource, program, and service needs.
- Developed a Microsoft Excel and VBA spreadsheet application model that
  calculated Edmonton Public Library branch library productivity (units of
  activity per hour per FTE) using a weighted formula incorporating various
  library input measures (investments and resources) and output measures
  (activity and use) to aid in branch library resource allocation decisions.
- Designed and created an RDF/XML metadata web application featuring web
  resources related to Alzheimer’s disease that was an experimental online
  version of the traditional library vertical file, part of a larger research
  project at the University of Western Ontario comparing traditional library
  information systems and the emerging standards and protocols of the Semantic
  Web.
- Developed a web-based survey using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP)
  stack to provide the data collection instrument for a SSHRC-funded grant to
  investigate students’ use of instant messaging on the University of Western
  Ontario campus.
- Designed and developed a digital resource repository application using a LAMP
  stack for the Canada-wide CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) in UME
  (Undergraduate Medical Education) Project out of the University of Calgary.
- Developed extended services for, and resources integration within, the
  Java-based bibliographic search tool TAL Online (using OCLC’s SiteSearch set
  of tools), a province-wide virtual union catalog maintained by The Alberta
  Library providing unified access to the catalogs of hundreds of libraries
  across Alberta (academic, public, and special libraries).
- Created a Microsoft Access and VBA bindery database application to automate
  the bindery process at the University of Alberta Libraries.

  collection utilizing Perl CGI scripts and SSI directives.
